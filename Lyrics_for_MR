// part-A1
When I saw you, for a glance,
It came upon to me, for a chance,  // (need further listening)
You've been my only one, 
that I've been looking for the world,
here and there so far away,

I catch up you, by a chance,
I loose my words, for a time, for surprise,
Cause you emit a strange,
like so feel so high, away, 
Magic Ray, stare at me, all the days!
// END of part-A1

// CHRORUS part of the song
Darlin', can't you see what is in me,
So, please please be with me,
What hardship over take to us,
I'll never turn you down!

Darlin', see and never off your eyes,
So, please be straight to me,
You are the only kind of one,
I will ever find!

I wish the time will come to me,
You come trully straight to me.
// END of CHORUS

// keyboard solo, as interlude,

// part-B
So, I need, I need only you,
But you, to me, you are what I need,
But you, to me, is the whole world to be,
So, for me, please be only straight to me,
And you, to me, the heaven likely buddy,
So please with me, please with me!
// END of part-B
